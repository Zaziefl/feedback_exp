<p>You are asked to take part in an experiment carried out by Zazie Flerackers and Wojtek Przepiorka, affiliated with Utrecht University. Please read the consent form carefully, taking as much time as you need. If you have any questions, please reach out to the organizers. You can decide not to join the experiment or quit the experiment at any time.</p>
<p>This experiment is conducted to understand how people make decisions. It will take approximately 35 minutes. You must be 18 or older to participate. The potential risks from taking part in this experiment are similar to decisions in daily life.</p>
<p>The experiment consists of two parts. In the first part, you will divide an amount of money between you and another participant in this session. In the second part, you will pick items that can be of different quality. Your earnings depend on your decisions, the decision of other participants, and partly, on chance. In addition to the decision-making tasks, you will be asked to answer a few survey questions related to your demographics (age, gender) and trust. If any question makes you uncomfortable, you may choose not to answer it.<p>
<p>Your identifying information will not be connected to your decisions in the experiment. The data for this experiment will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by EU law. No published results will identify you, and your name will not be associated with the findings. The results of this experiment may be published or presented at professional meetings, but the identities of all research participants will remain anonymous. The collected data will be stored and published according to open science standards.</p>

<p>Do not communicate with other participants, and do not involve people outside the experiment in your decisions. Do not share the participation link or code with anyone.</p>
<p>In case you have any questions about the experiment, please reach out via z.flerackers@students.uu.nl. </p>
