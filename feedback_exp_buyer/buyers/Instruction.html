<p>Please read these instructions carefully. You will complete a short quiz about your task and the rules on the next page.</p>
<p>In this part of the experiment, you will make decisions about items of varying quality. Your earnings depend on the quality of the items you select and, to some extent, on chance. You will complete between 12 and 20 rounds, with different rules introduced throughout. You will not be told the exact number of rounds in advance.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of <b>10 points</b>. Each round consists of up to three consecutive steps:</p>


<h3>Step 1: Select an item</h3>
<p>You will be presented with an item. This item has been offered by a participant in an earlier session of the experiment. This participant has set the item’s quality to either <b>good</b> or <b>poor</b>. Their earnings depend on the quality of the item and whether it is selected by you and/or other participants. If the item quality is good and the item gets selected, they will earn 15 points. If the item quality is poor and the item gets selected, they will earn 25 points. If the item is not selected, they will earn 5 points. .</p>
<p>You must decide whether to select the item. Your decision and the item's quality determine your earnings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the item is good, you earn <b>+10 points</b>, for a total of 20 points.</li>
    <li>If the item is bad, you lose <b>-5 points</b>, for a total of 5 points.</li>
    <li>If you do not select an item, you neither lose nor gain any points and the round ends immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not know the item's quality before making your decision. Other participants may have seen this item before you or may see it after you, but you will never know how many participants have encountered the item before or how many will see it after. Other participants may have left a rating for the item (positive, negative, or none). If they have left any, you will see this rating when you view the item.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <p><b>Important:</b> When you pick an item, there is a 20% chance that its quality will change. That means a good item could become bad, or a bad item could turn good in 1 out of 5 times you select an item. Neither you nor the seller controls this change, and you will not learn the item’s actual quality with certainty.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>Step 2: Decide whether to publish a rating</h3>
<p>After experiencing the item's quality, you will decide whether to publish a rating. Leaving a rating costs 2 points. This rating will appear next to the item and will be visible to other participants who may encounter the same item in a later round.</p>
<p>The specific rules for leaving a rating depend on the round that you are in. You will receive additional instructions for this throughout the session. </p>
<hr>

<h3>Step 3: Proceed to the next round</h3>
<p>When you finish your decision, you will move on to a new round, where you will receive another endowment of <b>10 points</b> and face a different item. This process repeats for multiple rounds. <b>You will never re-encounter the same item in a later round.</b></p>

<hr>

<h3>Earnings for Part 2</h3>
<p>Your earnings in this part depend on the quality of the items you select and, to some extent, on chance. Each round, you start with an endowment of 10 points. If you select a good item, you gain 10 points; if you select a bad item, you lose 5 points. Choosing not to select an item results in no change to your earnings. Additionally, if you choose to leave a rating, 2 points will be deducted.</p>
<p>Your total earnings for Part 2 will be the sum of your points across all rounds, converted at a rate of 50 points = €1. You will learn how much you earned in this part at the end of the experiment.</p>
